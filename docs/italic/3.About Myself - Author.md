I'm [Naruto Uzumaki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HafASrKaCYA). I like instant ramen in a cup, and I really like the ramen Iruka Sensei got me at the Ichiraku Noodle Shop, but I hate the three minutes you have to wait after you pour the water in the ramen cup. My hobby is eating different kinds of ramen and comparing them, and ***my future dream is to be the greatest ~~Hokage~~ penman!*** Then the whole village will stop disrespecting me and start treating me like I'm somebody. Somebody important! **BELIEVE IT**
